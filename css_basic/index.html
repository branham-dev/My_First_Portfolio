				<h1>In The Name</h1>
				<h2>Mark 16:16</h2>
				<p>He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.</p>
				<h2>Acts 2:38</h2>
				<p>Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
				<br />
				<hr />
				<p>Obviously, baptism is very important, but does it matter how we are baptized? Is there a correct baptism, or will anything work? If you believe the Bible, then YES, there is a correct baptism.</p>

				<h3>Here is the answer:</h3>
				<p>And there is no such a thing in the Bible as anybody ever being baptized in the name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost; because there is no such a thing. Father’s no name; and Son’s no name; and Holy Ghost is no name; but the Name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
